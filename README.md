# Potential Umbrella
This repo is a bunch of scripts that I use for various things at home and in my personal life. Probably nothing very special.

## Tarsnap Backup
This bash script is made to back up a couple of different Linux laptops around the house. It makes back ups of /etc as well as everyone in /home. It skips any files that are over 1GB in size.
